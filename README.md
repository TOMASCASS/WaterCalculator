# Water Usage Calculator

## Description

The Water Usage Calculator is a simple Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to estimate their average daily water usage based on various input parameters, including the number of showers, bathroom visits, laundry loads, and the use of water-efficient toilets and sinks.

## Features

- Input fields for the number of showers per week, daily bathroom visits, and monthly laundry loads.
- Checkboxes to indicate the use of water-efficient toilets and sinks.
- Calculates average daily water usage based on user inputs.
- Provides a user-friendly result displaying the average daily water usage in gallons.

## Prerequisites

To run the Water Usage Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the program uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. Tkinter is included with standard Python installations, so no additional installation is required.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program by executing the following command: python waterCalculator.py
5. The GUI will open, and you can enter your water usage parameters.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of showers you take per week.
2. Enter the average number of times you visit the bathroom per day.
3. Enter the number of laundry loads you do per month.
4. Check the boxes if you have water-efficient toilets and/or sinks.
5. Click the "Calculate" button.
6. The program will display the estimated average daily water usage.

## Customize

- You can modify the constants in the code for more accurate water usage estimates based on your specific fixtures.
- You can change the efficiency factors for water-efficient toilets and sinks if they are more or less efficient in your case.
